    info: `Overview: Have you ever been to a music festival? At one point in my life, they were all I lived for. Overthe last few years, I’ve slowed down a lot but the passion to go is still there. FestiShare is aplace where you can share that experience. Maybe you’re contemplating on whether to go tothis festival and don’t quite know anyone who has attended. FestiShare is here to solve thatproblem. Anyone can visit the site and check out any of the festivals and their reviews that havebeen added by other users. To add festivals and leave reviews, you must register for anaccount and be logged in. No need to use actual emails or passwords. As long as the email is inemail format (email@email.com) it will validate. Each festival is geo located with a convenientmap for visual preference. The idea for FestiShare came to me after I convinced some friends of mine to buy tickets to myfavorite music festival which I attend annually. The festival is called Lost Lands and is located inOhio. I can probably go on for hours describing just how amazing of an experience this place isbut that tends to get old after a while. After spending some time attempting to put my pastexperiences into words, the idea for FestiShare came to me. What if there was a site you canconveniently visit and get all the information on a festival you need? A place where people cannot only share their experience but give it a familiar star rating along with submitting some oftheir favorite pictures from their experience. Not only is this an outlet for people to share theirpersonal experience, but others who have yet to experience that particular festival, can readothers’ experiences and get an idea of whether this festival is for them. Enter, Festishare “Aplace to share your festival experiences.”What I learnedDeveloping FestiShare was the ultimate learning experience for me.`,
